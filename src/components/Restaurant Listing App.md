# Restaurant Listing App

This is a React application that fetches restaurant data from Swiggy's API and displays it in a user-friendly manner. The app allows users to search for restaurants by name and filter them by average rating.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-listing-app
cd restaurant-listing-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Code Overview

The app consists of the following main components:

- **Body.js:** This is the main component of the app. It fetches the restaurant data from the API and displays it in a grid. The component also includes a search bar and a button to filter the restaurants by average rating.
- **RestaurantCard.js:** This component displays a single restaurant card. The card includes the restaurant's name, average rating, and a link to the restaurant's page on Swiggy.
- **Shimmer.js:** This component is used to display a loading animation while the restaurant data is being fetched.

## How the App Works

The app works by making a request to Swiggy's API to fetch the restaurant data. The API returns a JSON response that contains the restaurant data. The app then parses the JSON response and extracts the relevant data, such as the restaurant's name, average rating, and link to the restaurant's page on Swiggy.

The app then uses the extracted data to create RestaurantCard components. The RestaurantCard components are then displayed in a grid on the page.

The app also includes a search bar and a button to filter the restaurants by average rating. The search bar allows users to search for restaurants by name. The filter button allows users to filter the restaurants by average rating.

## Conclusion

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and display it in a user-friendly manner. The app also includes a search bar and a button to filter the data. This app can be used as a starting point for more complex React applications.
